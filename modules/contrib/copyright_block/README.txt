INSTALLATION
------------

 * Go to /admin/modules and enable the Copyright Block module.
 * Go to /admin/structure/block and click "Place block" in the region where you
   wish to place the block (e.g. "Footer first").
 * Find "Copyright block" and click the "Place block" button next to it.
 * Configure the block, including the start year and separator. Change the
   copyright statement text as needed, though ensure that the
   [copyright_statement:dates] token is still present. The current year is
   added dynamically, and the start year and separator are shown when needed
   (i.e. if the current year is later than the defined start year).
 * Click "Save block".
